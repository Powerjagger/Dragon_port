        Why will people come to this site?
        Our target audience is members of the TTRPG community both new and old. Ideally we would attract the more creative types and more then likely our users will be those who play online rather than in person. In addition we also hope to attract freelance artistâ€™s in much the same way the places such as twitter or deviantart have, however with an emphasis on commission work placed at the top of priorities. This ideally would allow artists to be found by a group of people who are more likely to pay for commissions and players a clear list of artists to look through. The last group that we hope to attract would be small business owners. Sites like Etsy are able to be very profitable and act as a place for small business owners to sell their works. This site would ideally act in a similar way, however once again it would be more targeted. Advertising only works if done to an audience that appreciates it and thus this would allow these sellers to have a clearer line to the individuals interested in their product, under the pretense that it has some sort of theme that fits in a TTRPG world.

      <h3> Create account</h3>
      <p>
        What information do we require for uses?
        If an individual was just browsing then then we likely don't need anything from them. This means that they can look at goods and art being sold. However if someone wants to get more involved such as purchasing or joining/creating a game then we would require an account and ideally cookies. The account would likely have their email included to help protect against bots and we would need sale information (card number, address, etc) if they were planning on purchasing anything.

      </ul>Why come here?</h3>
      <p>
        Well there are many sites that can perform similar tasks and ours has three major benefits over our competitors. Firstly our site is independently owned and covers a large number of games. Currently there is a lot of controversy with the company who makes DnD (wizards of the coast) and many people have deleted their accounts on these sites, thus allowing an opening in the market. Secondly, many people enjoy the convenience of not needing to change sites. No one likes needing to sign up for a dozen subscriptions or needing to use 5 different websites for their tasks. With ours you only need one to act as a hub. Lastly we hope to be more connected with independent creators than other sites. Now this is the most difficult task however we believe that by reaching out we can get a number of individuals which will then lead to us gaining more as the site grows.

      <h3>Store</h3>
      <p>
        What problems will this site face?
        The first problem that this site will face is the lack of experience behind its creator, and the vast amount of connections that would need to be made. The second and likely biggest problem is that this site, much like its namesake of a port, lives and dies based on the people that come in. At the start there would be no one and very few people means that very few would want to come. Even once it does pick up steam there needs to be a diversity of people that come. The final problem would be how the site is shaped by the users rather than the admins. If we find that most players want to play cyberpunk games, then the artists who stick around would be the ones who could draw cyberpunk art. The same goes for all other aspects. If NSFW art becomes popular then that will reflect in other aspects of who visits. The same is true of the opposite in which if this site is squeaky clean that that will encourage a sizable number of individuals to look elsewhere. It's a balancing act that is determined by the people who use it.
