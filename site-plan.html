    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!-- The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn, then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6-digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them. -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
    Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#396e94</td>
        <td class="secondary">#e7c24f</td>
        <td class="accent1">#a43312</td>
        <td class="accent2">#381d2a</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did? Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point. Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>Heading Font: MedievalSharp</h4>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Kanit</h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Hey everyone, this is Dragon Port, your one-stop shop for all your TTRPG needs. Treat this place as a trade port where many people come by to showcase their wares or find other like-minded individuals.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      This site is able to stay up through advertisements; however, we try to only show smaller or independent groups, so don't expect to be seeing anyone raiding any shadow legends, "unless we got paid a lot."
    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file, change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      Why will people come to this site? Our target audience is members of the TTRPG community, both new and old. Ideally, we would attract more creative types, and most likely, our users will be those who play online rather than in person. In addition, we also hope to attract freelance artists in much the same way as places such as Twitter or DeviantArt have, but with an emphasis on commission work placed at the top of priorities. This ideally would allow artists to be found by a group of people who are more likely to pay for commissions, and players would have a clear list of artists to look through. The last group that we hope to attract would be small business owners. Sites like Etsy are able to be very profitable and act as a place for small business owners to sell their works. This site would ideally act in a similar way, but more targeted. Advertising only works if done to an audience that appreciates it, and thus, this would allow these sellers to have a clearer line to the individuals interested in their product, under the pretense that it has some sort of theme that fits in a TTRPG world.

    <h3>Create account</h3>
    <p>
      What information do we require from users? If an individual was just browsing, then we likely don't need anything from them. This means that they can look at goods and art being sold. However, if someone wants to get more involved, such as purchasing or joining/creating a game, then we would require an account and ideally cookies. The account would likely have their email included to help protect against bots, and we would need sale information (card number, address, etc.) if they were planning on purchasing anything.

    <h3>Why come here?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, there are many sites that can perform similar tasks, and ours has three major benefits over our competitors. Firstly, our site is independently owned and covers a large number of games. Currently, there is a lot of controversy with the company who makes DnD (Wizards of the Coast), and many people have deleted their accounts on these sites, thus allowing an opening in the market. Secondly, many people enjoy the convenience of not needing to change sites. No one likes needing to sign up for a dozen subscriptions or needing to use 5 different websites for their tasks. With ours, you only need one to act as a hub. Lastly, we hope to be more connected with independent creators than other sites. Now, this is the most difficult task; however, we believe that by reaching out, we can attract a number of individuals, which will then lead to us gaining more as the site grows.

    </p>
    <h3>Store</h3>
    <p>
      What problems will this site face? The first problem that this site will face is the lack of experience behind its creator and the vast number of connections that would need to be made. The second and likely biggest problem is that this site, much like its namesake of a port, lives and dies based on the people that come in. At the start, there would be no one, and very few people means that very few would want to come. Even once it does pick up steam, there needs to be a diversity of people that come. The final problem would be how the site is shaped by the users rather than the admins. If we find that most players want to play cyberpunk games, then the artists who stick around would be the ones who could draw cyberpunk art. The same goes for all other aspects. If NSFW art becomes popular, then that will reflect in other aspects of who visits. The same is true of the opposite, in which if this site is squeaky clean, that will encourage a sizable number of individuals to look elsewhere. It's a balancing act that is determined by the people who use it.

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      I want the home page to act more as a place to go to the other more specialized parts of the website. At the bottom, in theory there would be a new product shown there everyday. The Log in will change to your user name and act as a link when sighted in.
    </p>
    <img src="images/home_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

    <h3>games</h3>
    <p>
      [Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make clear]
    </p>
    <img src="/images/game_page.png" alt="Game page wireframe">

    <h3>Store</h3>
    <p>
      If there were additional products it would scroll down into several category's.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/store_wireframe.png" alt="Store wireframe">

    <h3>Artist Gallery</h3>
    <p>
      This would act as another jumping off point for people, but to get attention a new art peace would be shown at the bottom.
